# SortingAlgorithmsVisualizer
This app is visualizing sorting algorithms (currently only bubble sort implemented)

The app is written in Kotlin with KMM Compose multiplatform and is fully functional on both Android and iOS

## What do I want to achieve with this project?
I want to use a simple sorting algorithm in a more practical use case

This is my first project using KMM and I want to learn more about it

I want to become better at following architectural design patterns and explore especially clean architecture more


## What did I achieve and learn with this project?
I was able to visualize bubble sort in a simple way

With tutorials how to setup the project I got it fully working for both Android and iOS

I got to make better themes and used dynamic colors on Android and used dark and light theme for both Android and iOS

Even though it didn’t turn out like “fully” clean architecture I was able to learn more about use cases and reasoning behind the architecture
